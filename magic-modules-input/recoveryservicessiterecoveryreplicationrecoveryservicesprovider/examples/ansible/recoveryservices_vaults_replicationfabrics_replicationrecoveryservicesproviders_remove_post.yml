    Deletes provider from fabric. Note: Deleting provider for any fabric other
    than SingleHost is unsupported. To maintain backward compatibility for
    released clients the object "deleteRspInput" is used (if the object is empty
    we assume that it is old client and continue the old behavior).
  code:
    resource_name: myVault
    resource_group: myResourceGroup
    fabric_name: myReplicationFabric
