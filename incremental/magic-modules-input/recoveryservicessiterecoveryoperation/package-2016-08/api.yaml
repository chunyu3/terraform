If it is a PUT/PATCH on a collection or named value, Write should be used. If it is a GET, Read should be used. If it is a DELETE, Delete should be used. If it is a POST, Action should be used. As a note: all resource providers would need to include the "{Resource Provider Namespace}/register/action" operation in their response. This API is used to register for their service, and should include details about the operation (e.g. a localized name for the resource provider + any special considerations like PII release)'
