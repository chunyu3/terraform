The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the gallery Image Version to be deleted. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Resource location Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `gallery_image_name` - (Required) The name of the Shared Image Gallery Image Definition from which the Image Versions are to be listed. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `gallery_name` - (Required) The name of the Shared Image Gallery in which the Image Definition resides. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `storage_profile` - (Required) One `storage_profile` block defined below.
