# azurerm_network_security_group

Manage Azure NetworkSecurityGroup instance.


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the network security group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group` - (Required) The name of the resource group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `id` - (Optional) Resource ID. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Optional) Resource location. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `default_security_rules` - (Optional) One or more `default_security_rule` block defined below.

* `etag` - (Optional) A unique read-only string that changes whenever the resource is updated. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_guid` - (Optional) The resource GUID property of the network security group resource.

* `security_rules` - (Optional) One or more `security_rule` block defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) Resource tags. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

The `default_security_rule` block supports the following:

* `id` - (Optional) Resource ID.

* `description` - (Optional) A description for this rule. Restricted to 140 chars.

* `protocol` - (Required) Network protocol this rule applies to. Possible values are 'Tcp', 'Udp', and '*'.

* `source_port_range` - (Optional) The source port or range. Integer or range between 0 and 65535. Asterisk '*' can also be used to match all ports.

* `destination_port_range` - (Optional) The destination port or range. Integer or range between 0 and 65535. Asterisk '*' can also be used to match all ports.

* `source_address_prefix` - (Required) The CIDR or source IP range. Asterisk '*' can also be used to match all source IPs. Default tags such as 'VirtualNetwork', 'AzureLoadBalancer' and 'Internet' can also be used. If this is an ingress rule, specifies where network traffic originates from.

* `destination_address_prefix` - (Required) The destination address prefix. CIDR or source IP range. Asterisk '*' can also be used to match all source IPs. Default tags such as 'VirtualNetwork', 'AzureLoadBalancer' and 'Internet' can also be used.

* `access` - (Required) The network traffic is allowed or denied. Possible values are: 'Allow' and 'Deny'.

* `priority` - (Optional) The priority of the rule. The value can be between 100 and 4096. The priority number must be unique for each rule in the collection. The lower the priority number, the higher the priority of the rule.

* `direction` - (Required) The direction of the rule. The direction specifies if rule will be evaluated on incoming or outgoing traffic. Possible values are: 'Inbound' and 'Outbound'.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the resource that is unique within a resource group. This name can be used to access the resource.

* `etag` - (Optional) A unique read-only string that changes whenever the resource is updated.
