# azurerm_certificate

Manage Azure Certificate instance.


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The identifier for the certificate. This must be made up of algorithm and thumbprint separated by a dash, and must match the certificate data in the request. For example SHA1-a3d1c5. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group` - (Required) The name of the resource group that contains the Batch account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `account_name` - (Required) The name of the Batch account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `data` - (Required) The maximum size is 10KB.

* `format` - (Optional) The format of the certificate - either Pfx or Cer. If omitted, the default is Pfx. Defaults to `Pfx`.

* `password` - (Optional) This is required if the certificate format is pfx and must be omitted if the certificate format is cer.

* `thumbprint` - (Optional) This must match the thumbprint from the name.

* `thumbprint_algorithm` - (Optional) This must match the first portion of the certificate name. Currently required to be 'SHA1'.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `provisioning_state` - 

* `provisioning_state_transition_time` - 

* `previous_provisioning_state` - The previous provisioned state of the resource

* `previous_provisioning_state_transition_time` - 

* `public_data` - The public key of the certificate.
