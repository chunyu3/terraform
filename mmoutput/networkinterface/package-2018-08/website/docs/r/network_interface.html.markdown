# azurerm_network_interface

Manage Azure NetworkInterface instance.


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `enable_ipforwarding` - (Optional) Indicates whether IP forwarding is enabled on this network interface.

* `etag` - (Optional) A unique read-only string that changes whenever the resource is updated. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `ip_configurations` - (Optional) One or more `ip_configuration` block defined below.

* `mac_address` - (Optional) The MAC address of the network interface.

* `network_security_group` - (Optional) One `network_security_group` block defined below.

* `primary` - (Optional) Gets whether this is a primary network interface on a virtual machine.

* `resource_guid` - (Optional) The resource GUID property of the network interface resource.
