# azurerm_service

Manage Azure Service instance.


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Azure Search service associated with the specified resource group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `name` - (Required) The Search service name to validate. Search service names must only contain lowercase letters, digits or dashes, cannot use dash as the first two or last one characters, cannot contain consecutive dashes, and must be between 2 and 60 characters in length. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group` - (Required) The name of the resource group within the current subscription. You can obtain this value from the Azure Resource Manager API or the portal. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `type` - (Required) The type of the resource whose name is to be validated. This value must always be 'searchServices'. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Optional) The geographic location of the resource. This must be one of the supported and registered Azure Geo Regions (for example, West US, East US, Southeast Asia, and so forth). This property is required when creating a new resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `hosting_mode` - (Optional) Applicable only for the standard3 SKU. You can set this property to enable up to 3 high density partitions that allow up to 1000 indexes, which is much higher than the maximum indexes allowed for any other SKU. For the standard3 SKU, the value is either 'default' or 'highDensity'. For all other SKUs, this value must be 'default'. Defaults to `default`.

* `identity` - (Optional) One `identity` block defined below.

* `partition_count` - (Optional) The number of partitions in the Search service; if specified, it can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Values greater than 1 are only valid for standard SKUs. For 'standard3' services with hostingMode set to 'highDensity', the allowed values are between 1 and 3.

* `replica_count` - (Optional) The number of replicas in the Search service. If specified, it must be a value between 1 and 12 inclusive for standard SKUs or between 1 and 3 inclusive for basic SKU.

* `sku` - (Optional) One `sku` block defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to help categorize the resource in the Azure portal. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

The `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) The identity type.

The `sku` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Optional) The SKU of the Search service. Valid values include: 'free': Shared service. 'basic': Dedicated service with up to 3 replicas. 'standard': Dedicated service with up to 12 partitions and 12 replicas. 'standard2': Similar to standard, but with more capacity per search unit. 'standard3': The largest Standard offering with up to 12 partitions and 12 replicas (or up to 3 partitions with more indexes if you also set the hostingMode property to 'highDensity'). 'storage_optimized_l1': Supports 1TB per partition, up to 12 partitions. 'storage_optimized_l2': Supports 2TB per partition, up to 12 partitions.' Defaults to `free`.
